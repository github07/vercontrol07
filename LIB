We need to compile our library source code into position-independent code (PIC):
	$ gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic foo.c

Now we need to actually turn this object file into a shared library. Weâ€™ll call it libfoo.so:

	$gcc -shared -o libfoo.so foo.o

We need to tell GCC where to find libfoo.so
	$ gcc -L/home/username/foo -Wall -o test main.c -lfoo
We add the directory name to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Now running the fill ./test will work....
These commands can be saved in a script that will do the whole task.
